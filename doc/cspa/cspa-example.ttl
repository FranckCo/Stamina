				"The Seasonal Adjustment Service is a stateless service which exposes two functions for seasonal adjustment : one using the TramoSeats algorithm and another using the X13 algorithm. This functions are invoked using a request / response protocol. Because it is a stateless service, all the relevant input data must be provided through the request, and all the output data will be contained in the response. "
